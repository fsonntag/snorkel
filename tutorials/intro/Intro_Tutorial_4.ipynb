    "## Part IV: Generating _and modeling_ noisy training labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we will write **labeling functions** which express various heuristics, patterns, and [_weak supervision_](http://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/weak_supervision.html) strategies to label our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wild, hand-labeled training data is rare and expensive. A common scenario is to have access to tons of unlabeled training data, and have some idea of how to label them programmatically. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may be able to think of text patterns that would indicate to people mention in a sentence are married, such as seeing the word \"spouse\" between the mentions.\n",
    "* We may have access to an external knowledge base that lists some pairs of famous people who are married, and can use these to noisily label some of our mention pairs, such as Barack and Michelle Obama.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our labeling functions will capture these types of strategies. We know that these labeling functions will not be perfect, and some may be quite low-quality, so we will _model_ their accuracies with a generative model, which Snorkel will help us easily apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ultimately produce a single set of **noise-aware training labels**, which we will then use to train an end extraction model in the next notebook.  For more technical details of this overall approach, see our [NIPS 2016 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723)."

    "# Creating and Modeling a Noisy Training Set\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Creating labeling functions (LFs):** This is where most of our development time would actually go into if this were a real application. Labeling functions encode our heuristics and weak supervision signals to generate (noisy) labels for our training candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying the LFs:** Here, we actually use them to label our candidates!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training a generative model of our training set:** Here we learn a model over our LFs, learning their respective accuracies automatically. This will allow us to combine them into a single, higher-quality label set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add some detail on how to go about _developing labeling functions_ and then _debugging our model_ of them to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating Labeling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snorkel, our primary interface through which we provide training signal to the end extraction model we are training is by writing **labeling functions (LFs)** (as opposed to hand-labeling massive training sets).  We'll go through some examples for our spouse extraction task below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function isn't anything special. It's just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` as the input argument and returns `1` if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as true, `-1` if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as false, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: it labels only `1`s and `0`s, or it labels only `-1`s and `0`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to ultimately train a high-performance classification model that predicts which of our `Candidate`s are true mentions of spouse relations.  It turns out that we can do this by writing potentially low-quality labeling functions!"
